## What even is this?
This legendary RPG adventure, fittingly named **RPG_06_08**, will take you on a forgettable journey through exotic printlns, messy code, and grammatically incorrect commits. Dive into the lush world of bland protagonists and unbalanced stats and immerse yourself in the nonexistent story for an experience that makes critics say "Your code is broken" (Yoshiya Ohno, 2017)
